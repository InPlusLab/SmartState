# SmartState-dataset

This repo is used to provide our collection for real-world SRV attacks, for the purpose of supporting the ISSTA2023 submission#265 â€œ SmartState : Detecting State-reverting Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts via Fine-grained State-dependency Analysis

### The details for dataset

SmartState-dataset consists of two parts: 

1. 11 contracts that are collected based on reports of real-world attacks (see details via: https://github.com/forsubmit/Collection-for-real-world-SRV-attacks).

2. 36 contracts that are manually collected by inspecting and reviewing financial-related contracts(e.g., wallet and refund) from popular DApps.
